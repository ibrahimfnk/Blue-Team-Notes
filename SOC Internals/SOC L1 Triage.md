### Events
______

**Event**: Any activity that occurs such as user login, file download, process launch.

An Event is logged by the system, like OS or firewall or a cloud provider.

The Events are passed onto a security system like a SIEM or EDR.

### Alerts
___

**Alerts** are the notifications generated when an event or a series of events take place.

Alerts are generated by SIEMs, EDRs, SOARs and ITSM platforms.

Alerts have properties such as: 
{
	Alert Time: [Alert Time: March 21, 15:35, Event Time: March 21, 15:32] 
	Alert Name: [Unusual Login Location,  Email Marked as Phishing]
	Alert Severity: [Low, Medium, High, Critical] 
	Alert Status: [New, In Progress, Closed]
	Alert Assignee: [Alert Owner]
	Alert Verdict: [True Positive, False Positive]
	Alert Description: [- The logic of the alert generating rule, Why this activity can indicate an attack, Optionally, how to triage this alert]
	Alert Fields: [Host Name, Process Name, Commands executed]
}


#### Alert Prioritization
___

Every SOC team decides on its own prioritization rules and usually automates them by setting the appropriate alert sorting logic in SIEM or EDR.

A simple example of alert prioritization is as given below:

1. **Filter the alerts**  
    Make sure you don't take the alert that other analysts have already reviewed, or that is already being investigated by one of your teammates. You should only take new, yet unseen and unresolved alerts.
2. **Sort by severity**  
    Start with critical alerts, then high, medium, and finally low. This is because detection engineers design rules so that critical alerts are much more likely to be real, major threats and cause much more impact than medium or low ones.
3. **Sort by time**  
    Start with the oldest alerts and end with the newest ones. The idea is that if both alerts are about two breaches, the hacker from the older breach is likely already dumping your data, while the "newcomer" has just started the discovery.


## Steps to follow in a Triage
____

1. Take ownership of the alert. Assign the alert to yourself. 
2. Change the status to **In Progress**.
3. Read the alert description and alert fields.
4. Check for any already in place Workbooks(runbooks, playbooks). If so, follow the workbook.
5. Else, investigate the alert in the SIEM.
6. Make the final verdict on the alert. (True Positive/False Positive).
7. If escalation is needed, Escalate to L2.
8. Else, Add comments to the alert.
